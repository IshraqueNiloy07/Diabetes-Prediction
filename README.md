# Diabetes-Prediction
A thorough implementation of machine learning techniques for precise diabetes prediction may be found in this repository. Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, AdaBoost Classifier, Gradient Boosting Classifier, XGBoost Classifier, and ExtraTrees Classifier are among the eight distinct models that it employs. Together, these models forecast a person's likelihood of developing diabetes based on a variety of input factors.

The dataset has been suitably divided into training and testing sets, with 80% of the data devoted to training the models and 20% for evaluation, in order to guarantee trustworthy assessment measures. This section enables comprehensive model performance testing and validation.
