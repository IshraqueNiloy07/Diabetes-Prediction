# Diabetes-Prediction
A thorough implementation of machine learning techniques for precise diabetes prediction may be found in this repository. Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, AdaBoost Classifier, Gradient Boosting Classifier, XGBoost Classifier, and ExtraTrees Classifier are among the eight distinct models that it employs. Together, these models forecast a person's likelihood of developing diabetes based on a variety of input factors.

The dataset has been suitably divided into training and testing sets, with 80% of the data devoted to training the models and 20% for evaluation, in order to guarantee trustworthy assessment measures. This section enables comprehensive model performance testing and validation.

The project also makes use of Matplotlib's potent visualization features. The repository offers insights into the performance of the models and the dataset itself through eye-catching graphs. Furthermore, an assessment statistic called the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve is employed. This curve helps to visualize the trade-off between true positive and false positive rates, which helps to comprehend the accuracy and predictive capacity of the algorithms that have been put into place.
